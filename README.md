# leavebot

A script to automatically grow a robin room and leave it as soon as other leavebots outnumber regular users, and convinces users to install this, as explained in [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/robintracking/comments/4desi0/tier_15_ccandeshle/d1rf3j7).

#Installation

First, install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/). Then, click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joefarebrother/leavebot/master/leavebot.user.js) to install the leavebot. If you see a bunch of code, copy/paste it into greasemonkey/tampermonkey.


Only works in incognito mode, so you don't accidentally run this in your higher tiers.

There is a quieter fork [here](https://github.com/nzchicken/leavebot)
